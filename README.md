Project Title: StreetSpeaküõ£Ô∏èüöè‚Äì Your Voice for Safer Roads
In growing urban environments, citizens frequently encounter transportation and road-related problems such as potholes, damaged signboards, faulty traffic lights, improper parking, and unsafe pedestrian pathways. However, reporting these issues to the concerned authorities remains a major challenge due to the lack of an accessible and transparent system.
StreetSpeak is a smart, citizen-centric platform designed to empower the public to report transportation-related complaints directly to the responsible authorities. Acting as a digital complaint booth, StreetSpeak allows users to raise concerns by describing the issue, tagging its location, and uploading supporting images or videos. The application ensures that each report reaches the relevant department for timely action.
Authorities can use StreetSpeak to manage, prioritize, and resolve complaints while maintaining public transparency. Citizens receive real-time updates on the status of their submissions, fostering a sense of participation and trust in the system.
Key Features:
‚Ä¢	User-Friendly Complaint Submission: Text, images, location tagging.
‚Ä¢	Issue Categories: Road damage, traffic signal faults, public transport problems, etc.
‚Ä¢	Real-Time Tracking: Citizens can track complaint status and resolution.
‚Ä¢	Authority Dashboard: For efficient complaint management and response.
‚Ä¢	Data Analytics: Identify frequently reported issues and problem zones.
By acting as a bridge between citizens and civic bodies, StreetSpeak aims to create safer, smarter, and better-maintained public transportation systems through active public involvement
